  |   You are Sprocket, an adorable ferret on a remote space station.       |
  |   Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the      |
  |   most stuff!                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Widget Satchel is a thrilling adventure for one little thief, with    |
  |   fiendish puzzles, joyous platforming, and dozens of hidden            |
  |   collectables. As you stumble deeper though the station evading your   |
  |   human caretakers, you steal things like widgets and socks. And you    |
  |   stash them, because you're a ferret.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Every widget you collect adds to the weight of your satchel, making   |
  |   it a little harder to reach the next platform or avoid the            |
  |   station's maintenance bots. Stash enough widgets, and you can use     |
  |   them to fabricate doohickeys, which help you unlock new paths and     |
  |   previously out of reach areas. It's a ferretroidvania!                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But don't worry: You may lose some widgets (or your socks!), but      |
  |   Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no "game over". And nothing is   |
  |   blocking your path to the shuttlebay, so the game is only as          |
  |   challenging as you want it to be.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It's up to you: race though the station at top speed, or meander      |
  |   around knocking over piles of junk and hitting bots with your         |
  |   wrench. Or... gather up all your ferret-y determination to stash      |
  |   away each widget, discover every trinket, and try on all 30+ pairs    |
  |   of socks - including a Nintendo Switch exclusive pair of "Joy-Sock"   |
  |   that match your Joy-Con colors!                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Even after you finish the game, the adventure isn't over. Escape      |
  |   your playpen again (and again) to pursue different challenges.        |
  |   Ferret out all those hard-to-reach areas for a higher widget count,   |
  |   knock around more junk for a greater mischief score, or zoom          |
  |   through the station for a faster finish time.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The more you play, the more of the game's 20+ unique "feats" you're   |
  |   likely to accomplish, and the more you'll discover about the          |
  |   station, its human crew, and the Expedition they're a part of.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Just remember: Commander Key misses you, and is waiting patiently     |
  |   for you to return to her...                                           |
